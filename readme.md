This game is a remake of the C64 game Movie Business. It is a text based game where you choose an actor, a director and a location for your movie. You can advertise your movie in the paper, in the radio or on tv. Create a movie that wins awards and fills your moneybag! But be careful random events can influence your movie production in both, a positive and a negative, way.

This game is based on [Laravel](http://laravel.com) and [Twitter Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com)
